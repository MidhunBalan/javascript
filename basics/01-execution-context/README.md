# Javascript Execution Context

## Key Points:
* Everything in Javascript happens inside an Execution context
* Execution context has two parts, 
  1. Variable Environment(Memory Allocation Phase)
  2. Thread of Execution (Code Execution Phase) 

* Javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language. 
  → That means javascript can executed one command at a time in a specific order. 
  → It can only go to the next line once the current line has finished execution. 

* What happen when you run a Javascript program?
  → Execution context is created.
